    <p>Very often you dont feel like studying and it is normal
      and it happens to everyone and still happens to me too and it WILL Continue happening to us in the future
      but we need to understand and accept one thing,
      that it is better to suffer a bit Now and get job done than not doing it and regreting rest of your life,
      cause pain of discipline is Temporary but pain of regret is Permanent. </p>
    <h2>Stay strong my people</h2>
    <h3>Love you all </h3>
